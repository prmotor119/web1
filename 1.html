  <h3>I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me, and after all you are <strong>my <u>wonderwall</u></strong></h3>
  <p>Today is gonna be the day
  That they're gonna throw it back to you
  By now you should've somehow
  Realized what you gotta do
  I don't believe that anybody
  Feels the way I do, about you now</p>
  <p>Backbeat, the word was on the street
  That the fire in your heart is out
  I'm sure you've heard it all before
  But you never really had a doubt
  I don't believe that anybody
  Feels the way I do about you now
  And all the roads we have to walk are winding</p>
  <p>And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
  There are many things that I
  Would like to say to you but I don't know how</p>
